# xbar-plugins
Just a repository for the xbar plugins I use

## Notes

The plugins require files in a directory called `res/`

Classes parses a json file called `classes.json`. The formatting is as follows:

```json
{
  "classes":[
    "name":"",
    "number":"",
    "website":"",
    "canvas":"",
    "zoom":""
  ]
}
```

The images in Schedule need to be in base64 and in black and white. For some reason.
